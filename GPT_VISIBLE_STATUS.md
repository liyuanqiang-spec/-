## ChatGPT Supervision Contract

- ChatGPT writes safe work into `TASK_QUEUE.md`.
- The Mac mini worker pulls `main`, executes safe repository work, refreshes status files, commits, and pushes back.
- `DECISION_REQUIRED.md` is only for unresolved human decisions; resolved history must not change the visible state.
